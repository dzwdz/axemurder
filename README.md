# Not-For-Use-By-Organizations-That-Want-To-Axemurder-Me Software License
The Not-For-Use-By-Organizations-That-Want-To-Axemurder-Me Software License is a [nonfree license because it extends the four freedoms only to some kinds of organizations](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/programs-must-not-limit-freedom-to-run.html), not to all. Such a restriction in a software license, in the name of any cause whatsoever, imposes [too much power over users](https://www.fsf.org/bulletin/2019/fall/building-ethical-software-based-on-the-four-freedoms). Please don't use this license, and we **urge** you to avoid any software that has been released under it.
